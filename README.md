# WebVTT Ripper
WebVTT Ripper is an extremely simple application that will rip the subtitles (payload) out of .vtt files.

Currently there is only support for basic subtitles, like the ones auto-generated by YouTube. But feel free to extend it ;)

Subtitles in this format work:

```
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.139
This would be the subtitle
text that would be returned
```

The above would be returned as a single line:

`This would be the subtitle text that would be returned`

If there are any payload text tags in the payload, they will be included in the output.
